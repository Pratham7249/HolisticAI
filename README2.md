# Health and Wellness Application

This application provides a platform for users to access various health and wellness features, including diet plans, stress management resources, fitness plans, and mental wellness tools.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js:** You can download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository and `<repository_name>` with the name of the cloned directory.)*

## Setup

1.  **Initialize npm:**
    Navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal and run the following command to initialize Node Package Manager. This will create a `package.json` file for your project.
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
    *(The `-y` flag automatically accepts the default settings for the npm initialization.)*

2.  **Install dependencies (if any):**
    If your application has any dependencies (listed in a `package.json` file), you'll need to install them using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(If this is a new project and you haven't added any dependencies yet, you might not need to run this command immediately. You'll use it later if you decide to use external libraries or packages.)*

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the server:**
    To run the application, use the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    node new/app.js
    ```
    *(This command executes the `app.js` file located in the `new` directory.)*

2.  **Access the application:**
    Once the server has started successfully, you can access the application in your web browser by navigating to the following URL:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
 3.  **If cause error **
    If the server casuing error is then use:
    ```
    netstat -ano | findstr :3000 
    ```
 ```
     taskkill /PID 27844 /F
    ```
 ```
    taskkill /PID (no. of task that you want to terminate) /F (lets say we take 27844) 
    ```
 ```
    node new/app.js
    ```
    

 taskkill /PID (no. of task that you want to terminate) /F (lets say we take 27844) 
## Description of the Application

This application offers various features related to holistic health and wellness, as seen in the provided image. These include:

* **Diet Plan:** Likely provides users with personalized or general dietary recommendations.
* **Manage Stress:** Offers resources and tools to help users manage their stress levels.
* **Fitness Plan:** Provides fitness routines and guidance for users to achieve their fitness goals.
* **Mental Wellness:** Offers features and information related to mental health and well-being.

The application appears to use an EJS template engine for rendering dynamic web pages. You can navigate through the different sections using the links provided in the navigation bar.

## Further Instructions

* **Modifying the application:** To make changes to the application, you can edit the files in the `new` directory (specifically `app.js`) and any associated view files (likely in a `views` directory if using EJS). You may need to restart the server after making changes to see them reflected in the browser.
* **Adding dependencies:** If you need to use any external Node.js packages, you can install them using `npm install <package_name> --save`. This will add the package to your project's dependencies in the `package.json` file.
* **Database setup (if applicable):** If your application uses a database, you'll need to configure and set it up separately according to the instructions for that specific database.

Enjoy using the Health and Wellness Application!
